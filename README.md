# Oreon R2 Optimization Script 
As of now, Oreon R2 doesn't have much software in the repository or codecs. This script will automate the process of installing these features.
# How to run?
```
$ chmod +x optimize.sh
$ bash optimize.sh
```
This script will (probably) work for other RHEL/AlmaLinux/CentOS like systems. Either way, this script was built for Oreon R2.
